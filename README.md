## Intro

The main goal of OpenMoHAA is to ensure the future and continuity of **Medal of Honor: Allied Assault**. It has always been a dream in the community to provide patches and security fixes for the game. Thanks to the ioquake3 project, F.A.K.K SDK and other quality tools, OpenMoHAA has already reached more than half of its goal: to create an open-source version of MoH:AA (based on version 2.40) that is fully compatible with the original game (in terms of protocol, assets, and scripts).

## Getting started

- [Installing OpenMoHAA](docs/getting_started_installation.md)
- [Running OpenMoHAA and using expansion assets](docs/getting_started_running.md)
- [Dedicated server configuration](docs/configuration/server.md)

## Current state

### Single-player

The entire single-player campaign can be played from start to end. There may be occasional bugs though; if you encounter any, please create a new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/openmoh/openmohaa/issues) describing them.

### Multiplayer

The Multiplayer part is almost fully stable.

Server admins can use OpenMoHAA to [host](docs/getting_started_installation.md#server) a mohaa/mohaas/mohaab server. Bugs must be reported by creating a new [issue](https://github.com/openmoh/openmohaa/issues) on the OpenMoHAA GitHub project. Players can use OpenMoHAA to [play](docs/getting_started_installation.md#client) on a mohaa/mohaas/mohaab server.

All game modes including `Tug-of-War` from Medal of Honor: Spearhead, and `Liberation` from Medal of Honor: Breakthrough are implemented and are working as intended. Mods like `Freeze-Tag` are working as well.
